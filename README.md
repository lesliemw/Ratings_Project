A super simple do-it-in-an-evening type project. 

Using HTML, a ton of CSS, and a bit of basic Javascript I created a simple ratings page.

It consists of a landing page, giving the user the option of which rating to give to my imaginary company.

I used Bootstrap for the button styling, but pure css for the rest of it.

The ratings buttons had a hover element to change the color when the user hovered over them.

Once the user clicked on the rating they have chosen, I used Javascript to change the screen to a Thank You message. I also used Javascript to dynamically display what rating the user chose to give.
